## Technology used :

React, PureCSS ,Axios, Javascript, CSS, and HTML. Images and fonts were used. The API used was the PokeApi.

## Approach:
 I will make a home page that explains what the my web app does, and short description of its functions. Then  have a separate component for searching Pokemon/ a search page. There will be a Nav bar fixed to the left of the screen that has routes to Pokemon search page  and  Pokemon games component. When a specific Pokemon is searched it will then load up its description page, that has details on the Pokemon. The Pokemon games component will have the list of all Pokemon games that have released.


## User Stories
As a user I would like to navigate through the website easily with the nav bar that has both SEARCH and  the Pokemon games page . Have a search bar that when typed the results will have commonalities with the input box.  And when I click the individual Pokemon it has the description of the Pokemon in a separate page. 

## What's left?
More styling, most of my pages could use more styling and structure. But all the functionality is there.
